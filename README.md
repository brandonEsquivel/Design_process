## Description
Project Complete design process from design, specification, verification, synthesis, timin and layout of a specified counter module. Final project of the microelectronics course of the school of Electrical Engineering of the University of Costa Rica.
A behavioral description of a 4-mode counter is implemented in Verilog. This description will serve as a detailed and formal specification of the operation of the designed device, then verilog timing directives are used to check its paths and times with and without delays. structural design, timing & Layout stages are implemented.

## Counter

A case statement is used to execute 4 modes of counter operation:

** Count up.

** Count down.

** Count three at a time down.

** Parallel charging.

# How to run - Makefile

if you feel lazy, just:

--make Allcounter-- 

inside the makefile you can find detailed comments of the complation, synth and simulation steps.

## For more information(in spanish) see the report inside the docs folder.
